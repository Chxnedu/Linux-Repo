# text file containing various docker commands

* docker pull image (pulls the image you specify from the docker repo)

* docker run image (starts the container of that image)
# -d (to run the container in a detached mode)
# -p Hport:Iport (starts a container of an image with the ports attached)
# --rm (rm flag automatically removes the container when it exits)
# --name containername (give the container a specific name)
# -e SOMEVARIABLE (specifying environmental variables)
# --network some-network (specifying the network)
# -v /home/your-user:/root/docker-path (the -v flag is used to persist data between containers)

* the -v flag is deprecated, and the --mount flag is now in use
the --mount flag takes 2 options; volume and bind
volume takes 2 parameters "source"(the name of the volume) & "target"(mount location of the volume in the container)
bind takes 3 parameters; "type=bind" & "source" & "target"

* docker images (checks the images you have installed locally)

* docker ps (check for running containers... use -a flag to see ALL containers)

* docker stop containerid (stop a running container with its id)

* docker start containerid (start a stopped container with its id)

* docker logs containerid/name (checking the container logs for debugging)

* docker exec -it containerid/name /bin/bash or bin/sh (open a terminal inside of your container...'it' is interactive terminal)

* docker network ls (list all the docker networks)

* docker network create name (create your own docker network)

* docker-compose -f file.yaml up (docker compose command to start some containers from a yaml file)

* docker-compose -f file.yaml down (to stop the containers)   

* docker rm containerid (to remove a container)

* docker rmi containerid (to remove an image)  

* docker build -t myapp:1.0 ./ (command to build a docker image. -t to specify the name of the image and the other param to specify the path to the dockerfile)
# add the "--progress=plain" flag to see the steps as the image is being built 

* docker inspect imagename (can use this to see more details of a container)
