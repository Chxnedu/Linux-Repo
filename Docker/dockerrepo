# explaining how to create your own docker/container repo

* you use aws ecr for your repo. create a repo on aws, have aws cli on your machine already
configured and set up. follow the commands aws gives you

* to run your docker image on a prod server, youll have to pull it from the private
repo its on. to do this, edit your compose file containing the other containers your
app needs and add your container to it with the image being the uri from aws.
this docker compose file is now used to deploy your application and its services on the 
prod server
and remember to run your image from aws, youll need to be logged in on the prod server
so follow the steps above to do that.
