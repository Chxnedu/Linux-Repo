# notes for integrating jenkins with ansible

* setup your ansible server on a vm

* hook your tomcat server up with the ansible server

* install the publish over ssh plugin on your jenkins and configure the ansible server in global settings

* remember to edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to allow password authentication

* write your ansible playbook and modify your job to copy the artifacts and initiate the playbook
