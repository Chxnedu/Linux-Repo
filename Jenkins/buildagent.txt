to setup a jenkins build agent node, run another vm and install java

then run the following commands;

sudo useradd -m newuser #creating a new user

sudo -u newuser mkdir /home/newuser/.ssh

after that, you have to create ssh keys on the master node 

ssh-keygen

go to the slave node and enter this;

sudo -u newuser nano /home/newuser/.ssh/authorized_keys

paste the public key into the file and save. now youre able to ssh into the slave from the master

after that, run this command on the master;

sudo cp ~/.ssh/known_hosts /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh

then lastly, go to your jenkins ui and add the slave node
