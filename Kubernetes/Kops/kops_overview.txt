# kops is a production grade k8s tool for aws. To get started with kops, create the following:
- an s3 bucket to store the state of your cluster
- create a route53 hosted zone with a subdomain of your choosing, then add the NS records to your domain
- create an iam user for kops and grant admin privileges coz it'll be using a lot of services
- an ubuntu server ec2 instance where you'll install kops, awscli, kubectl

Now that kops is installed and configured, to create your cluster config, use this command
kops create cluster --name=kubevpro.chxnedu.com --state=s3://vprofile-kops-chxn --zones=us-east-1a,us-east-1b --node-count=2 --node-size=t2.micro --master-size=t2.micro --dns-zone=kubevpro.chxnedu.com

kops update cluster --name=kubevpro.chxnedu.com --yes
this is to actually create the cluster

You can configure that command as it pertains to your workload

export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://kops-state-storage-cluster
Use that command so that you dont keep adding the state to every kops command

kops export kubecfg --admin
Solution to error "cannot list nodes, unauthorized"
